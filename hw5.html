<br><br>
Whats missing:<br>
1.  I really do need to change the way checkpoints are handled.  You were right on how bad this approach is.  will
tackle this shortly.

<br><br>
Installing & Running. (will download all npm packages)<br>
1. sudo npm install 
2. cd into app directory, type in "sails lift"

<br><br>
Requirements met:<br>
1. Check & Uncheck using JQuery for Ajax..<br>
2. Validation of password is handled in both the model and controller.  I placed the validation in the controller because the 
valdation error messages were terrible.

<br><br>
Additional Items
1. Tag - https://github.com/armandopadilla/golden-eagle-flight-plan/releases/tag/cs520-hw5<br>
2. Zip submitted.<Br>
3. SQL scripts for populating - inside the scripts directory.<br>

<br><br>
1. Code which matters is within the "api" and "views" directories.  <br>
2. Running Tests - mocha test/unit/bootstrap.test.js test/unit/models/User.test.js
