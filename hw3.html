Whats missing:<br>
1.  Validation of input.<br>

1. sudo npm install

Requirements met:<br>
1. Tag - https://github.com/armandopadilla/golden-eagle-flight-plan/releases/tag/cs520-hw3<br>
2. Git Repo - https://github.com/armandopadilla/golden-eagle-flight-plan (wasnt sure if you wanted this in SVN)<br>
3. Zip submitted.<Br>
4. Tests - Using Mocha and should.  <br>
5. SQL scripts for populating - inside the scripts directory.<br>

<br><br>
